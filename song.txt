Yeah...
I know sometimes, things may not always make sense to you right now
But hey, what daddy always tell you?
Straighten up little soldier - stiffen up that upper lip
What you cryin about? You got me
[Verse 1]
Hailie I know you miss your mom, and I know you miss your dad
when I'm gone but I'm tryin to give you the life that I never had
I can see you're sad, even when you smile, even when you laugh
I can see it in your eyes, deep inside you wanna cry
Cause you're scared, I ain't there, daddy's with you in your prayers
No more cryin, wipe them tears, daddy's here no more nightmares
We gon' pull together through it, we gon' do it
